// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const requirements = "This is the second step, in which developers determine what the project will do and what elements will be required to integrate."
const design = "This is the third step. Developers plan how the user will interact with the app, how the app will be secured, how the programming will look, etc."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, where the code for the app is written."
const integration = "This is the fifth step. The app is tested for issues and released to be used."
const maintain - "This is the last step. Maintenance is ongoing to ensure that the user always has the optimal version to work with."
